            chuddai uddi
          </summary>
          <p>Chudiya Uddi" is a traditional hand-clapping game played by children in India. The game involves a group of children sitting or standing in a circle with their hands out, palms facing up. One person, usually the leader or "caller," starts the game by saying "Chudiya Uddi" (which translates to "Bangles flew") and raising their hands. The rest of the children mimic the action if the word "Uddi" (flew) is mentioned in context to something that flies. If the caller says something that doesn't fly but raises their hands, anyone who mimics the action is out. The goal is to pay attention and only raise hands for things that can fly.</p>
